LAUNCH = r"""## 1. How to open a notebook like this one, from a terminal

This section is repeated in full in every notebook in this project, so
that you never have to go looking in another file for it.

### 1.1 What you need

| you need | why | check it with |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust** (1.75 or newer) | the simulator is pure Rust and is built from source | `rustc --version` |
| **Python 3.8+** | Jupyter runs on Python, and this notebook is a Python notebook | `python3 --version` |
| **JupyterLab** or **Jupyter Notebook** | the program that opens `.ipynb` files | `jupyter --version` |
| the **posim** binary | the simulator itself; you build it once, below | `ls target/release/posim` |

You do **not** need SUNDIALS installed. You do **not** need a C or Fortran
compiler. You do **not** need any package from crates.io. The whole solver
suite — CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS, KINSOL, ARKODE — is a pure-Rust
translation vendored inside this repository, and `cargo` builds it from
the source that is already on your disk. Nothing is downloaded at build
time.

### 1.2 Build the simulator, once

Open a terminal and run these four commands. `$` is the shell prompt —
do not type it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/once-ere/rustSolveIt_macos-silicon_SUNDIALS_7_8_0.git
$ cd rustSolveIt_macos-silicon_SUNDIALS_7_8_0
$ cargo build --release -p posim
$ ls -l target/release/posim
```

The third command is the long one: it compiles the simulator and the whole
vendored SUNDIALS translation, and takes a few minutes the first time.
When it finishes, the fourth command must print a line describing an
executable file. If it prints `No such file or directory`, the build did
not succeed — scroll up in the terminal and read the first error, because
later errors are usually consequences of it.

### 1.3 Install Jupyter, if you do not have it

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install --user jupyterlab
$ jupyter --version
```

If `jupyter` is still "command not found" after this, your `pip --user`
scripts directory is not on your `PATH`. Print it and add it:

```bash
$ python3 -m site --user-base
$ export PATH="$(python3 -m site --user-base)/bin:$PATH"
```

To make that permanent, append that same `export` line to `~/.bashrc`
(bash) or `~/.zshrc` (zsh).

### 1.4 Start Jupyter and open a NEW notebook

From the repository root:

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```

That starts a small web server and prints a URL that contains a one-time
token, looking like:

```
    http://localhost:8888/lab?token=8f4c1e...
```

It normally opens your browser by itself. If it does not, copy that whole
URL — token included — into a browser. The token is the password; a URL
without it will be refused.

Then, inside JupyterLab:

1. **File → New → Notebook**.
2. When it asks you to *Select Kernel*, choose **Python 3 (ipykernel)**.
3. The empty notebook appears. Anything you type into a cell is Python.

Choose **Python 3**, and not the "posim" kernel that this repository also
ships, because this notebook is written in Python: it starts the simulator
itself, sends it commands, reads the replies back, and (at the end) opens
a graphical save dialog. Those are Python actions. The posim kernel speaks
only the simulator's own command language and cannot do them.

### 1.5 Running cells

- **Shift+Enter** runs the selected cell and moves to the next one.
- **Ctrl+Enter** runs the selected cell and stays put.
- Run the cells of this notebook **in order, from the top**. Each one
  builds on the state left by the ones above it, so skipping one will
  usually produce an error in a later cell.
- If things get into a confusing state, use **Kernel → Restart Kernel and
  Clear All Outputs**, then start again from the first cell.

### 1.6 If you would rather not use Jupyter at all

Everything this notebook does can also be typed straight into the
simulator's own prompt:

```bash
$ cargo run --release -p posim
```

That gives you an `In[1]:=` prompt where the simulator's commands are
typed directly. Type `HELP` for the command reference and `QUIT` to
leave. The Python in this notebook is a wrapper around exactly that
program.

GLOSSARY = r"""## 2. The words used in this notebook

Repeated in full in every notebook of this project, so that this notebook
stands alone.

**Body.** One rigid object. It has a *shape* (which fixes its moments of
inertia), a mass, a position, a velocity, an orientation and an angular
velocity. Bodies are created with the `NEW` command.

**Boundary / shape.** One of `point`, `sphere`, `cuboid`, `cylinder`,
`disk`, `torus`, `dumbbell`. The shape is not decoration: the simulator
computes the body's inertia tensor from it analytically.

**Static body / anchor.** A body with `inverse_mass = 0`. No force can
move it. It is how a mechanism is bolted to the world. A `point` anchor
additionally has a zero inertia tensor, so no torque can turn it either.

**Joint / constraint.** An exact geometric or kinematic relation that the
solver holds true for all time — not a stiff spring. Each joint
contributes a fixed number of scalar equations, called *rows*:

| command | rows | what it holds | freedoms it leaves |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CONSTRAIN a b [len]` | 1 | a fixed distance between two centres | 5 |
| `GEAR a b <axis> <ratio>` | 1 | a fixed proportion between two turns | 5 |
| `RACK p b <axis> <dir> <r>` | 1 | a turn tied to a slide, `ds = r dtheta` | 5 |
| `BALL a b` | 3 | one shared point | 3 (any rotation about it) |
| `UNIVERSAL a b <u> <w>` | 4 | a shared point and a right angle | 2 |
| `HINGE a b <axis>` | 5 | a shared point and a shared axis | 1 (the swing) |
| `PRISMATIC a b <axis>` | 5 | a line to slide along, and no turning | 1 (the slide) |

**Degrees of freedom.** Each free body has 6 (three of position, three of
orientation). A mechanism of `N` free bodies has `6N`. Subtract the total
rows of all its joints and what remains is how many independent ways the
mechanism can still move. If the subtraction leaves zero the mechanism is
locked; if the rows are not independent of one another the system is
*redundant* and the solver will refuse it rather than guess.

**The pivot rule.** Every joint that holds a point places that point at
the **midpoint of the two bodies' centres, as they stand at the moment the
joint is created**, and then remembers it in each body's own frame. So you
position the parts first and join them second, and the geometry you
assemble is the geometry you get.

**`g` and `g_dot`.** `g` is the vector of constraint equations; the solver
holds `g = 0`. `g_dot` is its time derivative, which the solver also holds
at zero. Their sizes are the total row count. The `CONSTRAINTS` command
prints the worst absolute value of each, and those two numbers are how you
tell whether a mechanism is really being held together: they should stay
near the solver's tolerance and never grow steadily.

**`METHOD IDA`.** Any mechanism with a joint must be integrated by IDA,
the differential-algebraic solver, and the simulator refuses any other
method rather than silently integrating an unconstrained problem.

FIRST_ORDER = r"""## 3. How a second-order mechanics problem becomes a first-order system

Repeated in full in every notebook of this project.

SUNDIALS — like every general ODE/DAE library — integrates **first-order**
systems. Newton's and Euler's equations are **second order**. This section
is the bridge, and it is the same bridge in every example.

### 3.1 The physics, as written by hand

For each body `i`, with mass `m_i`, inertia tensor `I_i` (in the body's own
frame), position `x_i`, orientation `R_i`, and angular velocity `omega_i`:

```
m_i * d2(x_i)/dt2 = F_i                            (Newton)
I_i * d(omega_i)/dt + omega_i x (I_i omega_i) = T_i   (Euler)
```

Both are second order in the configuration variables: the first is second
order in `x_i`, and the second is second order in orientation, because
`omega_i` is itself the rate of change of `R_i`.

### 3.2 The standard trick: name the velocities

A second-order equation becomes two first-order equations by giving the
first derivative its own name and letting the solver carry it as an
unknown alongside the position. This simulator carries **momentum** rather
than velocity, which is the same trick with a better-conditioned variable:

```
d(x_i)/dt = p_i / m_i                    <- was the definition of velocity
d(p_i)/dt = F_i                          <- was Newton's second law
d(q_i)/dt = 0.5 * quat(omega_i) * q_i    <- was the definition of omega
d(L_i)/dt = T_i                          <- was Euler's equation
```

with `omega_i = R_i I_i^-1 R_i^T L_i`, and `q_i` a unit quaternion holding
the orientation. Orientation is stored as a quaternion rather than as
Euler angles because quaternions have no gimbal lock and renormalise
cheaply.

### 3.3 The packed state vector

Each body contributes exactly **13 numbers**, in this order:

```
index 0..2    x       position
index 3..5    p       linear momentum
index 6..9    q       orientation quaternion, w first
index 10..12  L       angular momentum
```

so a model of `N` bodies has a state vector `y` of length `13N`, and the
whole of mechanics above is one first-order system `dy/dt = f(t, y)`.
That is what is handed to the Rust translation of CVODE or ARKODE.

### 3.4 When there are joints: a DAE, not an ODE

A joint is an algebraic relation between coordinates, not a rate, so it
cannot be written as `dy/dt = ...`. The system becomes *differential-
algebraic*, and this simulator uses the **GGL (Gear-Gupta-Leimkuhler)**
index-2 formulation, which carries **both** the position-level constraint
and its derivative, with a Lagrange multiplier for each:

```
d(x)/dt = v - M^-1 J^T mu        position, corrected by the multiplier mu
d(p)/dt = F + J^T lambda         momentum, plus the constraint force
0       = g(q)                   the joints hold, at the position level
0       = J u                    the joints hold, at the velocity level
```

`J` is the constraint Jacobian: row `k` of `J` is the gradient of the
`k`-th constraint equation with respect to all the coordinates, so `J u`
is the rate of change of the constraints under the current velocities.
`lambda` are the constraint forces, `mu` the position-level correction,
and `M^-1` the inverse mass/inertia metric — which is **not** optional,
because `J` has rows in different units and the correction has to be
mass-weighted to be dimensionally consistent.

Carrying both `g` and `J u` is what keeps the joints exact. A formulation
that enforced only the acceleration level would let `g` drift away
quadratically in time, and a mechanism would slowly come apart.

The unknowns are therefore `y` (the `13N` numbers above) together with
`lambda` and `mu` (one of each per constraint row), and the whole thing is
handed to the Rust translation of **IDA**, which solves systems of the
implicit form `F(t, y, y') = 0`.

### 3.5 Consistent initial conditions

A DAE cannot be started from just any state. The starting state must
already satisfy `g = 0` **and** `J u = 0` — the parts must be assembled,
and their initial velocities must be compatible with the joints. If the
velocities are not compatible, this simulator projects them onto the
nearest compatible set before starting, and reports how much it had to
change them. A start that needs no projection is one where you specified
velocities the mechanism can actually have.

DRIVER_MD = r"""## 4. How this notebook talks to the simulator

Repeated in full in every notebook of this project.

The next cell defines a small helper class. It launches the simulator as a
child process in **machine mode** (`posim --machine`), which makes it speak
JSON Lines: you send it one JSON object per line, and it answers with one
JSON object per line. This is the same interface the project's Jupyter
kernel uses internally.

The three calls used below are:

- `sim.do("...")` — run one simulator command and show what it printed.
  Adding `quiet=True` runs it without printing, which is what you want
  inside a loop that takes thousands of steps.
- `sim.get("obj.field")` — read one value back as a Python object.
- `sim.state()` — fetch the whole simulation state as a Python dictionary.

Nothing here integrates anything: every advance in time is performed by
the Rust SUNDIALS translation inside the child process.
