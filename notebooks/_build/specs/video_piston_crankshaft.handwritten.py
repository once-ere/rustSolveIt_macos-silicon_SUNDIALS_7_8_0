"abstract": """A slider-crank is the mechanism at the heart of every piston engine: a
wheel turning in a bearing, a rod hung off a pin near the wheel's rim, and
a piston that the rod pushes up and down a straight bore. It converts
rotation into a reciprocating slide, and back again.

What this notebook demonstrates is that the simulator gets the *kinematics*
exactly right without ever being told them. Nobody supplies the formula
relating piston position to crank angle. Four joints are declared, the
solver holds them, and the piston position that comes out agrees with the
exact closed-form expression to about one part in ten million.""",

"situation": """### The parts

| name | shape | mass | size | starts at | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mount` | `point` | 1 (but `inverse_mass = 0`) | — | origin | the engine block. Immovable: it is the main bearing's outer race. |
| `crank` | `cylinder` | 2 | radius 0.55, half-height 0.05 | origin | the crankshaft disc, spinning about the z axis at 2 rad/s |
| `rod` | `cuboid` | 0.4 | half-extents 0.5 x 0.05 x 0.05 | (1, 0, 0) | the connecting rod, a slender bar of length 1.0 |
| `piston` | `cuboid` | 1 | half-extents 0.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 | (2, 0, 0) | the piston |
| `guide` | `point` | 1 (but `inverse_mass = 0`) | — | (2, 0, 0) | the cylinder bore. Immovable: it defines the line the piston slides along. |

`mount` and `guide` are *static bodies*. Their `inverse_mass` is zero, so
no force can accelerate them; and because they are `point` shapes their
inertia tensors are zero too, so no torque can turn them. They are the
parts bolted to the world.

The two moving-mass shapes matter numerically, not decoratively. A
`cylinder` of mass `m`, radius `r` and half-height `h` has

```
I_zz = 0.5 m r^2                      about its axis of symmetry
I_xx = I_yy = m (3 r^2 + 4 h^2) / 12  about any diameter
```

and a `cuboid` of half-extents `(a, b, c)` has

```
I_xx = m (b^2 + c^2) / 3 ,  I_yy = m (a^2 + c^2) / 3 ,  I_zz = m (a^2 + b^2) / 3
```

These are computed by the simulator from the shape you declare. You never
type an inertia tensor.

### The interactions

There is **no gravity** (`g_constant = 0` switches off mutual attraction
between the bodies, and `uniform_gravity` is set to zero) and **no contact**
(`collide off`). Every force in this model is a *constraint* force: the
force a bearing exerts to stop a shaft leaving it, the force a pin exerts
to stop a rod coming off. Nothing is driven and nothing is damped, so the
mechanism coasts on the kinetic energy it was given at the start.

### Why the geometry is what it is

Every joint in this simulator places its pivot at the **midpoint of the two
bodies' centres as they stand when the joint is created**. So the sizes are
not free. Write `a` for the crank throw and `L` for the rod length. The
midpoint rule puts the big-end pin at half of the rod's centre coordinate,
so the rod's centre must sit at `2a`; but a rod reaching from the crank pin
at `a` to the wrist pin at `a + L` has its centre at `a + L/2`. Those agree
only if

```
L = 2a
```

Here `a = 0.5` and `L = 1.0`, so the main bearing lands at the origin, the
crank pin at `x = 0.5`, and the wrist pin at `x = 1.5` — every pivot on a
real pin. Any other ratio and the picture and the mechanism disagree.

### Why the rod ends are ball joints and not hinges

Every pin in a real engine is a hinge, so four `HINGE` joints is the
obvious thing to try. It does not work, and the reason is worth
understanding because it recurs in every planar linkage:

```
HINGE 5 + HINGE 5 + HINGE 5 + PRISMATIC 5 = 20 rows,  on 18 freedoms
```

Three free bodies give 18 degrees of freedom, and 20 constraint equations
on 18 unknowns is over-determined. The equations are not contradictory —
they are *redundant*: each hinge separately insists the motion stays in the
z = 0 plane, and it gets said three times. A redundant constraint set makes
the solver's matrix singular, and this simulator refuses such a model
rather than picking an arbitrary solution.

The standard remedy, and the one real multibody codes use, is to give the
connecting rod **spherical ends**:

```
HINGE 5 + BALL 3 + BALL 3 + PRISMATIC 5 = 16 rows,  on 18 freedoms
```

That leaves `18 - 16 = 2` freedoms. One is the crank angle — that is the
mechanism. The other is the rod's spin about its own long axis, which is
passive: nothing applies a torque along the rod's length, so that freedom
simply stays where it started. The run below measures it, and it is
0.000 degrees.""",

"eom": """Each of the three moving bodies obeys Newton's and Euler's equations. With
no gravity and no contact, the only applied loads are the constraint forces
`F_c` and constraint torques `T_c` that the joints generate:

```
m_crank  * d2(x_crank)/dt2  = F_c,crank
m_rod    * d2(x_rod)/dt2    = F_c,rod
m_piston * d2(x_piston)/dt2 = F_c,piston

I_i * d(omega_i)/dt + omega_i x (I_i omega_i) = T_c,i      for i = crank, rod, piston
```

The `omega x (I omega)` term is the gyroscopic term, and it is not
negligible here: it is what makes the crank speed up and slow down.

None of these constraint forces are written down by you. They are the
Lagrange multipliers, solved for at every step so that the joint equations
in the next section hold exactly.

**The exact kinematic consequence.** Although the *dynamics* need solving,
the *geometry* has a closed form. Measuring the wrist pin position `x` from
the crankshaft axis, with crank angle `theta`:

```
x(theta) = a cos(theta) + sqrt(L^2 - a^2 sin^2(theta))
```

This is exact — no small-angle approximation anywhere. The stroke runs from
`L - a = 0.5` at bottom dead centre to `L + a = 1.5` at top. The run below
checks the simulated piston against this formula at every sample.

**Note what the crank does *not* do.** It does not turn at a constant rate,
and it should not: nothing drives it. It was given 2 rad/s and left alone,
and the rod and piston trade inertia with it through the cycle, so the
crank angle wanders ahead of and behind a uniform `2t`. The closed form
above is unaffected, because it is a statement about the *linkage* — it
relates the piston to whatever angle the crank happens to be at. That is
exactly what makes it a fair test of a free-running mechanism.""",

"constraints": """Four joints, 16 scalar equations. Writing `r_i^P` for the position of the
point `P` expressed in body `i`'s own frame, and `R_i` for body `i`'s
rotation matrix:

**1. `HINGE mount crank [0,0,1]` — 5 rows.** The crankshaft in its main
bearing. Three rows hold a point shared, two hold an axis shared:

```
g_1..3 = (x_crank + R_crank r_crank^O) - (x_mount + R_mount r_mount^O) = 0
g_4..5 = [ p . (R_crank z) ,  q . (R_crank z) ] = 0
```

where `p` and `q` are two directions perpendicular to the hinge axis. The
last two rows say the crank's z axis has not tipped away from the world z
axis, leaving one freedom: the rotation about it.

**2. `BALL crank rod` — 3 rows.** The big end, on the crank pin. One point
shared, all three rotations free:

```
g_6..8 = (x_crank + R_crank r_crank^B) - (x_rod + R_rod r_rod^B) = 0
```

**3. `BALL rod piston` — 3 rows.** The little end, on the wrist pin:

```
g_9..11 = (x_rod + R_rod r_rod^W) - (x_piston + R_piston r_piston^W) = 0
```

**4. `PRISMATIC guide piston [1,0,0]` — 5 rows.** The bore. Two rows kill
the two translations across the slide direction `n = (1,0,0)`, three kill
all rotation:

```
g_12..13 = [ p . d ,  q . d ] = 0      where d = x_piston - x_guide - (relevant offset)
g_14..16 = the three rows that hold the piston's frame aligned with the guide's
```

leaving one freedom: the slide along `n`.

**Total: 5 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 16 rows on 18 degrees of freedom.**

Every one of these is held at the position level (`g = 0`) *and* at the
velocity level (`d(g)/dt = J u = 0`) simultaneously, which is what the GGL
formulation described above is for.""",

"reduction": """**Sizing this particular problem.**

There are 5 bodies, so the state vector `y` has

```
5 bodies x 13 numbers = 65 components
```

and it is laid out as five consecutive 13-number blocks, in creation order:
`mount`, `crank`, `rod`, `piston`, `guide`. Within each block the order is
position (3), linear momentum (3), quaternion w-first (4), angular momentum
(3).

The two static bodies still occupy their 13 slots. Their `inverse_mass` is
zero, so their momentum-to-velocity map returns zero and they never move —
they are carried as constants rather than special-cased out of the layout.

On top of the 65 differential unknowns there are the algebraic ones: one
Lagrange multiplier `lambda` and one position-level multiplier `mu` for each
of the 16 constraint rows, so

```
16 lambda + 16 mu = 32 algebraic unknowns
```

giving 97 unknowns in total, solved as one implicit system.

**What is handed to the Rust SUNDIALS translation.** Because there are
joints, this is a DAE, and the command `METHOD IDA` selects the pure-Rust
translation of **IDA**, SUNDIALS' implicit differential-algebraic solver.
IDA is handed a residual function of the implicit form

```
F(t, y, y') = 0
```

built from the four blocks written out earlier: the position rows carrying
the `-M^-1 J^T mu` correction, the momentum rows carrying `+J^T lambda`, the
16 rows `g(q) = 0`, and the 16 rows `J u = 0`. IDA runs its variable-order,
variable-step BDF method and calls back into that residual; the Newton
solve at each step is what determines the constraint forces.

**Tolerances.** This mechanism has joints that grip orientation (the hinge
and the prismatic guide both constrain rotation), so the tolerance floor
for orientation joints applies: `rtol` is held no tighter than `1e-6` and
`atol` no tighter than `1e-8`. That is not timidity — the index-2 accuracy
ceiling is real, and asking for more produces convergence failures rather
than better answers.

**Consistent start.** The initial velocities in this model are not
guessed. At top dead centre the piston is momentarily at rest and the rod
turns about the wrist pin, so the compatible velocities are `omega_rod =
-a*omega/L` about z, with the rod's centre riding at `a*omega/2`. Those are
what the model sets, so `J u = 0` holds to roundoff at t = 0 and the
simulator has nothing to project away.""",

simulated piston position and `a cos(theta) + sqrt(L^2 - a^2 sin^2(theta))`
is a few parts in `1e8` over half a revolution — the exact figure is
printed above. That is the real result
here. Nobody supplied the formula; the solver was given four geometric
relations and asked to hold them, and the exact kinematics of the
slider-crank fell out.

The residual is not zero, and it should not be. Two things bound it: the
`rtol = 1e-6` floor that orientation joints impose, and the fact that the
piston position is quadratic in time near dead centre, so any sampling at
finite `dt` clips the extremes very slightly.

**The passive freedom.** The rod's roll about its own axis measured 0.000
degrees. This is the concrete payoff of choosing spherical rod ends over
revolutes: the extra freedom that made the model solvable is genuinely

left alone, and the rod and piston trade inertia with it as the geometry
changes through the cycle. The closed form is untroubled by that, because
it relates the piston to whatever angle the crank has actually reached — a
statement about the linkage, not about the timing. Testing it against a
free-running mechanism rather than a driven one is what makes it a real
test.

**Things worth trying.** Change `angular_velocity` on the crank and the
stroke will not change at all, only how fast it is traversed. Change the
rod's `half_extents` without changing the piston's starting position and
the model will still assemble, but the pins will no longer land on the
parts, because `L = 2a` will have been broken.""",
